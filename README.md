**Overview**
The goal of the competitionis to use time series data generated by a learning game to determine if a player will answer a question correctly. This repository will be using Gradient Boosted Tree Models from tensor flow in this classification competition. Each question will be used to train its own model. My average accuracy was (unfinished). The best preforming kaggle competitor have an average accuracy of 75.6%.
